The following two graphics are based on Exhbits 4 and 5 in the Skyway-West Hill Subarea Plan Equity Impact Analysis (p.7). These graphs show slightly different results from those included in the draft document because they use the most recent CHAS data (2012-2016), which were not yet availabe when the original graphs were produced. The original graphs were created by a third party consultant (BERK Consulting) who prepared the Equity Impact Analysis on behalf of King County.
